At utterance begin, SIL accounts for 100.0% of phone occurrences, with duration (median, mean, 95-percentile) is (84,86.3,114) frames.
At utterance end, SIL accounts for 100.0% of phone occurrences, with duration (median, mean, 95-percentile) is (100,98.8,122) frames.
Overall, SIL accounts for 51.2% of phone occurrences, with duration (median, mean, 95-percentile) is (30,42.9,111) frames.
Overall, nonsilence accounts for 48.8% of phone occurrences, with duration (median, mean, 95-percentile) is (28,31.1,52) frames.
Overall, Y accounts for 29.1% of phone occurrences, with duration (median, mean, 95-percentile) is (26,25.6,29) frames.
Overall, N accounts for 19.8% of phone occurrences, with duration (median, mean, 95-percentile) is (38,39.3,57) frames.
The optional-silence phone SIL occupies 59.1% of frames overall 
Limiting the stats to the 69.6% of frames not covered by an utterance-[begin/end] phone, optional-silence SIL occupies 41.2% of frames.
Assuming 100 frames per second, the alignments represent 0.0 hours of data, or 0.0 hours if SIL frames are excluded.
Utterance-internal optional-silences SIL comprise 44.4% of utterance-internal phones, with duration (median, mean, 95-percentile) = (27,27.3,39)
